# Integrating CodeCov and ApVeyor 

Companion repository to the blog post "CodeCov Test Coverage Integration" on the AppVeyor website.

The post is written from the point of view of someone (me) who is already proficient in C# and unit testing, but was new to AppVeyor and integrating CodeCov with GitHub.

It contains from scratch steps to run CodeCov test coverage on a sample C# project using [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/). 

This is the repo that I created to test the blog post, which you can use for clues if you have trouble following the instructions in the post.

Obviously, it being a post about Code Coverge, there is a badge to display the results :)
